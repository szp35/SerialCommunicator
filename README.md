# SerialCommunicator
A program that allows you to communicate via serial ports, such as USB. It has tabs on the left, 
so multiple connections can be made at once. It uses C#'s build in SerialPort library, so it isn't great. 
Planning on building my own SerialPort library, but that might not actually happen.
